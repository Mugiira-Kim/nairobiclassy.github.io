            <h1 style="color: white;">The Rise and Rise of Internet Fathers.</h1>

        

        <h2 style="color: orange;">Many young men are lost and without guidance. The online fathers are filling this gap.</h2>
<br>

  <h4> I will speak from my personal experience; <br> 
  </h4> 

<p>  I am your average 30 year old male. I have a university degree and two years of work experience,
that is until I lost my job to the pandemic. <br>
<br>

It was after the excitement of having a new job had faded that I really started to feel lost. 
I remember walking to work one morning, and I suddenly felt so small against the skyscrappers, among the traffic, the people. I remember asking myself, 'Is this it?' 
Is this what everything was leading up to? <br>
 So what do I do now?  <br>
 What do grown people do? <br>
 <br>
 At this point I must note that these were general questions,
 I had no doubts about my masculinity at all.  <br>

 <br>
 <br>
 I met a girl at work (4 years older), and I latched onto her like a bug. 
 We would chat on phone for hours (if you've worked a call center job you know how it is), 
 she would laugh at my jokes (I'm not funny, at all), but all in all it was really a great time I had with her, she would even bring me breakfast almost every morning. I gained weight really fast after meeting her.
 <br>
All this time, I was desperately trying to figure out my why. I had been a good boy in school, 
almost broke bad in campus but graduated, and now I was a call center officer, and the apple of my parents' eyes. They seemed about done with me. <br>
<br>
I remember being suicidal, which makes me dangerously impulsive. <br>
One evening after work, in one of my episodes, I call up this lady and ask for her company. I went to her place that night. When she let me in, I did not say a word, I hugged her and cried like a baby for an hour. It was so releiving. I slept immediately after, cradled in her arms. 
<br>
The next morning I felt embarassed but she made no mention of it. She made breakfast and we went to work like nothing had happened. <br>
<br>
After that night she had me. There was no doubt that this would be the woman I spend my life with. <br>
So I went all in. My feelings of being lost had vanished and now I had a purpose; to build a life with this amazing woman.  <br>
<br>
  Everything moved pretty fast after. We moved in together one year later. Things changed when we moved in though. The cute, charming lady suddenly became very abusive and bossy and I was more and more confused. The one person I thought I could turn and cry to was gone, now she was as mean as mean could be.
  <br>
  <br>
  Getting her pregnant only fed the beast in her and I couldn't take it anymore. I remember locking myself in the bedroom and crying over a bottle of vodka and some cheesy music after the fights erupted. I WAS SO CONFUSED. "But I do everything? What more could she want?" Is what I would ask myself. 
  <br>
  At this point, I was cooking, cleaning, making sure to not leave the toilet seat up, paying bills, driving her to and from work etc. Surely she should see that I am man enough, right? Isn't that what a man is supposed to do in a relationship. This was my purpose, I was fully invested, it had to work. 
</p>
  <br>
  <br>

  <h4>Out of options, I turned to the internet; </h4> <p>
    To help me with my relationship.
    <br> <br>
     I was desperate now, I had to find a solution. Of course, there's the generic, cheasy advice given by women which only made things worse. But then, I discovered the internet father figures. <br>

  After consuming this content, I was pumped up and ready to stand my ground. I left. <br>
  Now since she was pregant, I did not just dissapear, I moved to a different house within the same building, 
  and gave her an ultimatum that when she is ready to be civil, she knows where to find me. <br>
  This actually surprised her, I almost did not go through with it because of how shocked she was, but I stuck with it. <br>
  <br>
  Well, a few  days later when I was away, she moved. I had no idea where she had moved to.
  <br> <br>
  I was devastated. How dare she? <br>
  <br> </p>
  <br>
 <h4> Now what do I do with my life?</h4> 

 <p>
    Now, I was by myself, and soon to be a father. I had no idea what to do, where to go or how to feel.<br>
    I had to face all these feelings by myself. It was then that I began to question my masculinity. <br>

    <br>
    The online platforms that discuss masculinity seemed to be the only place to turn to. I then realized my experience was similar to many others. I came accross women who admitted to treating their husbands and boyfriends so poorly and they were not sorry about it. That these men should know how to be men or else they will henpeck them mercilessly. <br>
    <br>  
    All this information made me even more angry.
    </p> 
    
    <h4>But I thought that was misogynistic?</h4>
<br>
    <p>
    I was appalled at first. Isn't this the kind of man I have been trained not to be? 
    Wait, was I being trained to be less of a man? <br>
    How come all the men that come accross as misogynists are adored by the women and I labeled as weak? 
    I thought we were equal to women?  <br>
    <br>
    I turns out that in the real world, things are very different. Women still want the traditional man. They also want the sweet, modern man to walk all over. 
    
    <br><br>
    So what sort of man I should I be? A hybrid? 
    <br>
    How do I know when to switch? 
    <br>
    <br>
</p>

<h4>Internet Fathers to the Rescue</h4>

<p>
    They have been labelled as toxic, misogynistic, they have been gagged and banned from the internet. Many women and men are baying for their blood. But we that know and have experienced the earth's wrath for not owning and developing our masculinty, we know better. <br>
    <br>
    You know, the world has gotten so soft and sensitive that we cannot beleive that people would go online, give brutal advice and still get a following.
    <br>
    It seems more fitting for such advice to be given harshly. Don't be diplomatic with it. "If I'm being a piece of shit, just tell me I'm a piece of shit and I will thank you for it." 
    
    <br>
As men we have no option but to suck it up, we all feel hopeless, cry and are afraid. There's comfort in knowing that all men struggle. I however will not go to cry to another man or woman about how hard my life is, instead I will ask how they got past it. <br>
<br>
The soothing, politically correct advise might make you feel all warm inside, but reality is harsh. Our internet fathers are not trying to sugar coat their advise because it needs to be served hot. 

<br><br>
If you can't handle it, don't cancel it.   

<br><br>
<p>  I am slowly but surely learning the ropes of manhood and fatherhood. The world is brutal for an unguided, shielded male like I was. I am slowly gaining my confidence back. This advice has not made me angry towards women, I am becoming more assertive in my relationships with women.
 I wouldn't have known where to start without the online father figures. I pray that every young man gets to learn from them from an early age. </p>
