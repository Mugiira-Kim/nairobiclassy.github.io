            <h2>My Love for Nairobi Escorts
            </h2>
            <p>
                I can only tell you why I did it as a man who has frequented prostitutes. It's not like we explain why we use escorts at the water cooler, therefore I have no idea why other men do it.. Because I am dissatisfied with one component of my relationship. Almost every woman I've ever dated or been in a relationship with eventually had unreasonable expectations of me, and when I fall short of those expectations, cutting off sex is one of the most effective ways to force me to bend to their will. The criteria I'm referring to are those that demand that I always be thoughtful, kind, selfless, attentive, romantic, supporting, emotionally present, and available at all times—while still being content to let my own physical and emotional needs go unmet. For instance, if a man cooks you a nice meal every day of the week, changes the baby's diaper without being asked, completes some of your chores for you, purchases flowers for you, compliments you, tries to set up romantic dates, takes out the trash without being asked, always lowers the toilet seat, and generally does everything they can to be a present partner and make your entire week, not just your day, wonderful, then you should consider dating them.
                However, something happens that suppresses the woman's libido in place of actual intercourse. Maybe your friend breaks up with her boyfriend and you have to console her. Maybe you worry about the internet bill. Maybe you can't stop thinking about that one irritable coworker. Maybe it's July and you're wondering what to get your mom for Christmas. Maybe you remember a time when your man irritated you ten years ago. Or, anything else that makes you cranky, even a headache, is a good enough excuse to give your man the cold shoulder.
                The man in this case, however, is denied sex for what seem to him to be trivial or minor reasons despite the fact that he has done nothing wrong and may even have done everything correctly. Most males are probably understanding of this if it happens once in a blue moon; I know I was; but you know what? As the years pass, incidents like these become increasingly frequent, which makes the man feel terrible. For me, it turns into a perpetual cycle of trying to give my partners all I have while receiving little to nothing in return, and worrying about every move I make and word I utter. Women I've dated have wanted me to constantly be at my best for them, but few of them are prepared to do what I enjoy doing the most in return. Additionally, attempting to solve the issue in the relationship and having conversations about it always seems to make having sex even less likely.. Some guys will leave you for another woman outright or have an affair, while others, like me, will pay for sex to relieve our stress and satiate our desires. Although we don't want to hurt the ladies we are with, something has to give eventually. For guys like myself who don't want to go out and get another partner and restart this entire shit process, a prostitute is pretty much the only option. We all want to get laid and have our hard work rewarded, but for the most part, that doesn't happen, so we keep using prostitutes and beating ourselves up over it.
