          <h2 style="color: white ;">More Kenyan Women are Paying For Sex</h2>
          <p> 
            What do you do when you need to unwind after a busy week at work but don't have time for a real boyfriend?
            <br>
            <br>

     It's always assumed that it's men who always buy sex. After all, women do not need to, right? 
     A woman can have sex whenever she wants. Why would she pay for it? Well, despite these 'truths' the number of women buying sex from male escorts in Nairobi is increasing. Research shows the number of male escorts has tripled in the last five years. 
     Single women who are busy with work and do not have time for relationships, women with partners that want to spice up their sex lives, women who want to be in control of the sexual experience, women that want their sexual satisfaction prioritized instead of worrying if their partner is satisfied, are now finding that male escorts are what they've been missing. 
     <br> <br>
     It's a long way off. There is a wide range of gender, sexuality, services, suppliers, and clients in the world of sex work. However, because phallocentric narratives about subservient female sexuality are so deeply ingrained, many people fail to take into account the fact that women use sexual services to satiate their arousal needs. But they undoubtedly do.


     In this article we will look into why this is happening, <a href="https://www.nairobiclassyescorts.com/maleEscorts.html">where women can get escorts</a> and the experiences of Kenyan women who have used Kenyan escorting services. 
          </p>
            
       
             <h4>Why would a woman pay for sex?
            </h4>
             <p>
             Why would a lady spend money on sex? This question is based on the heteronormative presumption that males always seek out sex; therefore, why would a woman pay for something that is easily accessible and abundant? A penis is just a right swipe away in our rapid sex world.

             <br>
             <br>
             But how about satisfying sex? How simple is that to find? Sex that is exclusively focused on you. A situation in which you are unrestricted in expressing your most secret fantasies and living them out in a setting devoid of criticism? What about intimate encounters when everything is entirely in your control with a skilled partner? When was the last time you had that kind of sex? Kenyan women are searching for something much more satisfying than simple, everyday intercourse.
             </p>
            

              
             <h5 style="color: orange ;">Where to Get Sex Now</h5>
            
           <p>   It is easy to get sex online in Nairobi. You just need to find the best available escorts. <a href="https://www.nairobiclassyescorts.com/maleEscorts.html"> See escorts online here!</a></p>

              <h4 style="color: white ;">What do the scholars say?</h4>
            
<p>
  Because not everyone is prepared to admit to this activity and because some people may not view their own behavior through the perspective of prostitution, it is impossible to determine exactly how many women have paid for sex. The latter may have its roots in the fact that many women see prostitution as inherently exploitative when men are the ones paying for it, but they do not see it that way when women are the ones paying for it because they feel that there is a more equal power exchange in those situations.


  <br>
  <br>
  But regardless of how you look at it, a lot of kenyan women buy sex. So what have they encountered? What spurs them to purchase sex in the first place? A recent study in the journal "Sexualities" provides some clarification.

  <ul style="color: white ;">
    <li>
      Most kenyan women who bought sex through an  <a href="https://www.nairobiclassyescorts.com/maleEscorts.html">escort or agency </a> said they were generally happy with their experiences, but one-third of them said things did not go as planned (e.g., they felt rejected by the sex worker, the worker was unprofessional, or the worker oversold their sexual skills). Despite some having less than ideal encounters, all of the women said they would be willing to pay for sex in the future.
    </li>

    <li>
      A sexual issue (such as vaginismus, in which the vagina reflexively contracts, making intercourse difficult and/or unpleasant) or the recovery from trauma were among the top two reasons given by some of the women for buying sex (such as having a history of intimate partner violence or having experienced childhood sexual abuse). Additionally, the transgender participant stated that it was crucial for her to be treated like a lady by her partner and that she thought sex workers would be less judgmental in this regard.
    </li>

    <li>
      According to the researchers, several of the women reported attaining their therapeutic objectives, and "many interviewees recommended sexual treatments should be rebatable from Medicare."
    </li>

    <li>
      Many Kenyan women claimed they paid for sex because they wanted to learn more about sex, including how their own bodies worked, their sexual orientation, and trying out new sex acts (some of the women bought services from same-sex providers) (such as BDSM).
    </li>

    <li>
      Most women claimed that their desire for intimacy played a role in why they purchased sex. In other words, it involved more than just sex but also an emotional bond.
    </li>

    <li>
      Another important motivation was pleasure, such as the desire to "completely indulge" and to absorb pleasure rather than impart it.
    </li>

    <li>
      Many of the women stated they thought buying sex was emotionally safer than having casual sex, and others said they felt physically safer buying sex than having casual sex. However, other women admitted to experiencing initial anxiety and fear about purchasing sex, and a few even went so far as to set up safety measures like having a security backup for the first session.
    </li>

    <li>
      A third of the individuals claimed that purchasing sex gave them a stronger sense of self-worth. Some even claimed that these advantages carried over into unpaid sex, making it simpler to arrange and manage casual encounters with additional partners.
    </li>

    <li>
      he majority of the women claimed that, in part because of feelings of stigma associated with this behavior, they did not tell many other individuals that they had purchased sex. The majority, though, claimed that they would "unconditionally" advise a close friend to purchase sex.
    </li>
  </ul>
