          <h2 style="color: white ;">More Kenyan Women are Paying For Sex</h2>
          <p> 
            What do you do when you need to unwind after a busy week at work but don't have time for a real boyfriend?
            <br>
            <br>

     It's always assumed that it's men who always buy sex. After all, women do not need to, right? 
     A woman can have sex whenever she wants. Why would she pay for it? Well, despite these 'truths' the number of women buying sex from male escorts in Nairobi is increasing. Research shows the number of male escorts has tripled in the last five years. 
     Single women who are busy with work and do not have time for relationships, women with partners that want to spice up their sex lives, women who want to be in control of the sexual experience, women that want their sexual satisfaction prioritized instead of worrying if their partner is satisfied, are now finding that male escorts are what they've been missing. 
     <br> <br>
     It's a long way off. There is a wide range of gender, sexuality, services, suppliers, and clients in the world of sex work. However, because phallocentric narratives about subservient female sexuality are so deeply ingrained, many people fail to take into account the fact that women use sexual services to satiate their arousal needs. But they undoubtedly do.


     In this article we will look into why this is happening, <a href="https://www.nairobiclassyescorts.com/maleEscorts.html">where women can get escorts</a> and the experiences of Kenyan women who have used Kenyan escorting services. 
          </p>
            
       
             <h4>Why would a woman pay for sex?
            </h4>
             <p>
             Why would a lady spend money on sex? This question is based on the heteronormative presumption that males always seek out sex; therefore, why would a woman pay for something that is easily accessible and abundant? A penis is just a right swipe away in our rapid sex world.

             <br>
             <br>
             But how about satisfying sex? How simple is that to find? Sex that is exclusively focused on you. A situation in which you are unrestricted in expressing your most secret fantasies and living them out in a setting devoid of criticism? What about intimate encounters when everything is entirely in your control with a skilled partner? When was the last time you had that kind of sex? Kenyan women are searching for something much more satisfying than simple, everyday intercourse.
             </p>
            

              
             <h5 style="color: orange ;">Where to Get Sex Now</h5>

              <h4 style="color: white ;">What do the scholars say?</h4>
            
<p>
  Because not everyone is prepared to admit to this activity and because some people may not view their own behavior through the perspective of prostitution, it is impossible to determine exactly how many women have paid for sex. The latter may have its roots in the fact that many women see prostitution as inherently exploitative when men are the ones paying for it, but they do not see it that way when women are the ones paying for it because they feel that there is a more equal power exchange in those situations.


  <br>
  <br>
  But regardless of how you look at it, a lot of kenyan women buy sex. So what have they encountered? What spurs them to purchase sex in the first place? A recent study in the journal "Sexualities" provides some clarification.

  <ul style="color: white ;">
    <li>
      Most kenyan women who bought sex through an  <a href="https://www.nairobiclassyescorts.com/maleEscorts.html">escort or agency </a> said they were generally happy with their experiences, but one-third of them said things did not go as planned (e.g., they felt rejected by the sex worker, the worker was unprofessional, or the worker oversold their sexual skills). Despite some having less than ideal encounters, all of the women said they would be willing to pay for sex in the future.
    </li>

    <li>
      A sexual issue (such as vaginismus, in which the vagina reflexively contracts, making intercourse difficult and/or unpleasant) or the recovery from trauma were among the top two reasons given by some of the women for buying sex (such as having a history of intimate partner violence or having experienced childhood sexual abuse). Additionally, the transgender participant stated that it was crucial for her to be treated like a lady by her partner and that she thought sex workers would be less judgmental in this regard.
    </li>

    <li>
      According to the researchers, several of the women reported attaining their therapeutic objectives, and "many interviewees recommended sexual treatments should be rebatable from Medicare."
    </li>

    <li>
      Many Kenyan women claimed they paid for sex because they wanted to learn more about sex, including how their own bodies worked, their sexual orientation, and trying out new sex acts (some of the women bought services from same-sex providers) (such as BDSM).
    </li>

    <li>
      Most women claimed that their desire for intimacy played a role in why they purchased sex. In other words, it involved more than just sex but also an emotional bond.
    </li>

    <li>
      Another important motivation was pleasure, such as the desire to "completely indulge" and to absorb pleasure rather than impart it.
    </li>

    <li>
      Many of the women stated they thought buying sex was emotionally safer than having casual sex, and others said they felt physically safer buying sex than having casual sex. However, other women admitted to experiencing initial anxiety and fear about purchasing sex, and a few even went so far as to set up safety measures like having a security backup for the first session.
    </li>

    <li>
      A third of the individuals claimed that purchasing sex gave them a stronger sense of self-worth. Some even claimed that these advantages carried over into unpaid sex, making it simpler to arrange and manage casual encounters with additional partners.
    </li>

    <li>
      he majority of the women claimed that, in part because of feelings of stigma associated with this behavior, they did not tell many other individuals that they had purchased sex. The majority, though, claimed that they would "unconditionally" advise a close friend to purchase sex.
    </li>
  </ul>

        Women Also Want Good Sex
      </h2>

      <p>
Inside Africa and African business, we all beleive and agree that a man should actively pursue a woman and not the other way around. This makes the man to feel like he's conquered. He hunted, gathered and yes - killed. Women are seen  simply as prey and should always be passive in every aspect of any relationship. Sit and wait to be pursued.  <br> <br>

We have at some point met one man who swore he wouldn't take the woman he's had os too sexual relations with to his mama's, because?  <br>
Gal is too sexually active and liberated to be a wife! <br>
Wife materialism in a kenyan woman is meausured by her sexual passiveness and inability to communicate what she wants, how shw wants it, and when. They'd still lay such a woman but nah! Ain't walking them down the aisle. A wife material should never be sexually woke. 
<br> <br>

Sexual liberation in a Kenyan woman  downgrades a man. It sort of badly squeezes his balls and crushes his already fragile ego. It's why you see some mwn judge Kenyan women who buy and use sex toys. I mean, why would sex toys intimidate Kenyan men? <br> <br>

When you hear out our brothers talk about a 'loose woman' they're simply telling you about a woman who sees sex as just that -sex and is not emotionally attached to some man jusy because he gave her a good lay. <br>
A loose woman is one who treats a man like a sexual object and would pick a man she wants, on her own terms. If she is straight, plain and forward about sex, ooh, gal is a hoe! Like, a woman should be chill and get laid and actually feel used after that, <br> <br>

From the days of our forefathers, sexual pleasure was always a male thing. A woman was never to enjoy sex. <br>
Sex was meant to give pleasure to the men in their lives and bring forth children for the continuation of a generation. A woman was not even supposed to talk about or desire sex. <br>
This is why for a woman to have had sex before marriage was a great achievement but God forbid, why would a Kenyan woman get laid before she gets married? She must remain pure, a prize for her future husband, a man who has been emptying his balls from illegitimate escapades all over the village! 

<br> <br>

Female sexual desire and confidence is still a taboo in our world today and no man can openly talk positively about female sexual aggressiveness. A woman's orgasm and her sexuality is never an issue, should never be discussed and has no place in man's brain. Why would a woman talk about what she wants done to her and how? Teah or lead a man to how she should be touched? And done? Who's spoilt daughter is that one even? <br> <br>

The major reason why very few men satisfy their women is the fact that they can never accept that a woman's satisfaction is as important as theirs. And since it is assumed that from birth, a man doesn't need to be told or taugh about sex, a good number fail terribly in this duty. <br>
Women too, are afraid of being judged and slut shamed if they show that they know too much about sex than their men. <br>
A guy wants to have fun and get really down for a lass and enjoy being blown but it should be kept at that. <br>
He loves her in a sexy red lingerie perfoming all the bedrobatics while risking her spinal cord. But a man would never marry such a woman because she is too sexually exposed and experimental to be a wife. She knows way too much and will be sleeping around with every man in the hood doing monkey and crocodile styles. 
<br> <br>
The reality is women have as much (if not more) sexual appetite as men do. You would be foolish, as a husband, dismiss this. While you are chasing young girls looking for that fulfilment, best be sure that your wife is on <a href="https://nairobiclassyescorts.com/">NairobiClassyEscorts</a> checking out our <a href="https://www.nairobiclassyescorts.com/maleEscorts.html">nairobi call boys </a> who know how to put a woman's needs first.
