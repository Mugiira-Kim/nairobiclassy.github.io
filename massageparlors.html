            <h1 style="color: white;">Massage Spas and Prositution</h1>

        

        <h2 style="color: orange;">How Massage Spas Turned Prostitution Dens Operate in Nairobi </h2>

        <p>
        <a href="https://www.nairobiclassyescorts.com/index.html"> Nairobi Massage Parlors </a> AKA mordern day brothels uses dirty tricks to entice clients to sleep with masseuses. Masssage Parlor is a new euphemism for modern day brothel in Nairobi. YOu walk in to releive tension or pain and you could just walk out sexualy satisfied. Sex trade has penetrated massage parlors, making them modern day brothels.
        Word has been spreading around about multiple massage parlors offering sex as an extra. 
        <br> <br>
        Massage Parlors are now everywhere in Nairobi, even in residential areas. Some advertise their services, some don't. You can walk into a barber shop in Nairobi, get a haircut and then a five minute head massage before they tell you, 'we also offer full body massage,' of course at a certain fee. The masseuses at the barber shops ofte wear short and revealing clothes exposing their thighs and or cleavages. They intentionally squeeze their head in between their boobs while doing the head massage and when they notice you are sexually aroused then they pop the big question; Full body massage. 
        <br>
        <br>
        If you agree they will lead you to a room that you didn't even imagine existed in that barber shop. There again, they will tell you another word which you probably don't know its meaning, 'they offer happy ending.'  Happy ending is a euphemism that means they are also offering you sex service at a fee. You sleep with that masseuse who turned you on  or go home with blue balls (epididymal hypertension) 
    
    <br>
    <br>
        Massage Parlors that advertise their services operate differently from the ones found in barbershops which operate clandestinely. You walk into these massage parlors as a client seeking a relaxing proffessional massage. Maybe you have muscle fatigue or joint pain, and the treat you like they really understand your problems. At the reception you are handed a menu with a list of the different types of massage offered at the facility. Graphics on the menu are usually erotic giving you a feeling of what to expect from the massage listed. 

        <br>
        <br>
        Among the types of massage offered are Nuru body to body massage, sweedish massage, deep tissue massage and four hands massage. Four hands massage means you wil have two masseuses massaging you at the same time. For Nuru, the masseuse will soak his/her naked body in oil and rub it againts your body. Sweedish massage is a simple one just to calm you down. Deep tissue massage is the one where they press your veins hard, to releive of any pains. Nuru Massage will be recommended as the best option and it will be hinted that you are allowed to sleep with the masseuses. 
        <br>
        As the receptionist explains their services, a group of young ladies will be seated accross the reception dressed skimpily as they eagerly wait for you. You are almost undressing them with your eyes at this point. 
        <br>
        <br>
        After making a payment you are led to the ladies, from whom you will choose one to massage you. The lady you choose will lead you to one of the chosen rooms where you will get your relaxing massage. The room is usually dimly lit and a nice fragrance, all pointing to a spectacular experience ahead. The lady will request you to take a shower first, hand you a towel and lead you to the bathroom. As you are cleaning up, the lady puts on smooth music to set the mood for the massage. Meanwhile, your clothes are kept in a drawer together with your other belongings. They are very honest and don't steal from their clients. Phones are not allowed during the massage session. 

        <br>
        <br>
        Moments later, you lie naked on a nice, raised bed with only your butt covered with a white towel. She will smear massage oil on your back and legs and rub her elbows in spaces beside your backbone, and her hands harder between your thighs. 
        <br>
        <br>
        "By the way, do you want any extras?" The masseuse will ask you moments later when you are at the peak of your massage. Being that you are green and probably not in your right sences you might ask what she means by extras? She will tell you that she can give you a happy ending if you like. 
        <br>
        And if you agree she tells you that you won't need to pay for it at the reception, you just pay her instead. You will think the management doesn't know that the masseuses offer sexual services, and that is exactly what they want you to think. 
        <br>
        By now you have probably said yes to her sex proposal, she'll tell you the charges. She might list specific services with different prices, for example; Hand job for 700 shillings, blowjob for 1600 shillings, vaginal sex for 3000 shillings and so on. You might be alarmed if you've never paid for sex, but the masseuse will make you feel relaxed and at ease.
        <br>
        <br>
        Sex trade in massage parlors is widespread accross Nairobi. You might think the only clientelle is men but women too do get such services.  Married women in particular flock massage parlors looking for satisfaction from youthful men who offer massage extras in parlors accross the city.

<h3 style="color: white;">
    Female masseuse, "We are not stealing husbands." Mans Chamber 'Barbershop'.  
</h3>

<p> Female barbers and masseuses are taking over the barbershop industry which has been until now dominated by men. Mwende Fray is one such female barber who has recently gone viral on twitter after her barber shop advertisement caught the eye of the internet. Mwende owns the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/manschamberbarbersandspa?refid=52&paipv=0&eav=AfbWGwSLXEQTWaMx56-d-bok6bA5MB8yJBmzcvtBGxieN7gdlS0-VqPMB_F_VUhBLvw">Mans Chamber barbershop</a>  located along the Eastern Bypass that's causing a buzz online. In other words, this massage parlor fronts itself as a barbershop. 
 <br>
 <br>
  Mwende: "I'm sexy, I'm fabulous, I'm confident with my body. A woman is beautiful, kwanini tufiche? And it has worked for this business, men love seeing nice things. Nani anataka kwenda kunyolewa alafu unashikwa na mikono ngumu? It's better to come here, you're pampered, soft hands, soft voices, you relax. We don't allow women here so your wife won't find you."
  <br>
  <br>
  Controversy has surrounded Mwende's Man Chamber kinyozi, with many terming it a brothel in disguise, something that Mwende is quick to dispute. 
  <br>
  <br>
  Mwende: "This is not a brothel. Let me correct the people that think this is a brothel. This is not a brothel, it's just a grooming den for the kings, where they are served by African maidens."

  <br>
  <br>
  Besides offering haircuts, full body massages, full body scrubs, waxing, manicures and pedicures, Mwende's Mans Chamber also offers some free twerking on the side, which she says is part and parcel of her job.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mwende: "It's a daily thing. I've got lots of beautiful women here, my assistants are beautiful ladies, they are proud of themselves, they love dancing, they love music, and I told them to be free. So yeah, they twerk all over. They twerk in the morning, they twerk in the afternoon, they twerk in the evening, all the time."
  <br>
  <br>
  The sassy enterpreneuer has disputed claims that she is in the business of luring men from their wives and girlfriends, and that she is all about taking care of the male species. 
<br><br>
  Mwende: "If you don't want your husband to come here, wash his feet when he comes home, give him a massage when he comes home and look pretty. Otherwise he'll come here we'll serve him, we'll pamper him, we'll groom him up. You should be thanking us actually 'cause we're doing the work that you're not. "
  <br>
  <br>
  Anne Macharia, a masseuse at the Mans Chamber has also flared at her detractors maintaining that this is a legitimate business and not some sort of a sexualized project. 
  <br>
  <br>
  Anne; "Me I find it to be so normal because even when you look at most of the successiful ladies like those singers, they just use their body and are still faithfully married. So I think it's okay. Like, we're girls, we're attractive, so I don't see the reason why we shouldn't show off."
  <br>
  <br>
  Stanley Macharia, a married man who frequents Mans Chambers, says that he enjoys the services of these young girls and that his wife is totally okay with him seeking the services of Mans Chamber. 
  <br>
  <br>
  Stanley: "I actually have a wife, na anajuanga nakijanga hapa. Nilimwambia kuna kinyozi imefunguliwa na nataka kujua services zao venye ziko. Akaniuliza, "Nani wananyoa huko?" Nikamwambia ni madame. Akaniambia, "Ni sawa, you just go and have the experience, ujue venye wananyoa at least."  She is okay"
  <br>
  <br>
  Ruth Wanjiku, a female barber who has had her business for the last 10 years, says that she ventured into the male dominated field after seeing how crowded salons were crowded and how at times customers would be nagging. But she has learned to overcome the challenges and even win the trust of her formerly jelous husband. 
  <br>
  <br>
  Ruth: "At first it wasn't easy, 'cause siunajua the way men are jelous. So anaona nashinda na wanaume, but later on alikuja kukubali juu anaona wife yake ako sawa, ni kazi and hakuna those side things. He just accepted it. Kuona I've been in the industry for long, si rahisi 'cause client saa zingine anakuja na motive tofauti. Maybe mwingine anakuja anakwambia anataka kunyolewa but deep inside anatake maybe the touch. Then mwingine anakuja, anataka tu kukuchokoza, yeah. "
  <br>
  <br>
  Mary Muhia, a budding female barber and head barber at Mans Chamber remains proud of her job and sees nothing wrong with looking gorgeous while in the line of duty. 
  <br>
  <br>
  Mary: "Sisi ni kazi tunafanya. We know what we're dealing with so we're focused. We are just here to do our work. We're not here to take people's husbands, we're not here to make their wives feel bad. We're just here to make you guys comfortable, good, happy, good looking. Unapata hizi haircuts, by the time unatoka hapa you'll be happy."

Secret Brothels for the Rich. 
</h2>

<p>
    Nairobi is a big bedroom. Kabarnet Road is littered with secret brothels for the super rich where they pay 10,000 shillings for sex. Within this affluent neighborhood there is a members only brothel that serves Nairobi's mighty and the rich. So hidden is this establishment that the average person cannot access it unless they are invited by a member. The sex den is located in an office block with salons, an electronic equipment company and several offices to ensure premium cover.
    
    <br>
    <br>
    To access this den, a patron must stop at a permanently locked iron gate and press the gate bell. Women are expensive here. The gate is electronically opened from the inside after the operator has checked out the CCTV camera and confirmed you are either a member, worker or provider of essential services to the members. Once the gate is opened one gets in through a corridor that leads to a well stocked bar. To the normal person, the bar is just another normal bar for the rich. So discreet is the operation in the bar that it is impossible to know that in there are more than 20 women who have already undressed, waiting or servicing the members of the brothel. 
    <br>
    <br>
    To get a woman to cheer a regular visitor, you contact the bartender or the impecably dressed woman at the bar to facilitate a hookup with an available woman. The patron will then go upstairs where women, some naked, and some wearing only panties, parading themselves for the man to pick his choice. Sex with a woman here costs 10,000 shillings for one hour, inclusive of a shower, a massage and room. 
    <br>
    <br>
    Most patrons walk in, have a drink or two in the bar and then go upstairs and come back downstairs two minutes later grinning like little kids. The regular patrons are well known people. <br>
</p>
    <h4>19 year old making money </h4>
<p>
     "I can massage up to 10 clients and earn 2000 shillings from every man in a day. If I am too good for the man, he is likely to add me more money, which will be my tip that I don't share with management. "
     She claims she has saved enough money for two years of university education after working at the sex den for nine months. She adds that she has regular clients who come there specifically for her. Even when she is with another client, they will wait for her until she is done. <br>
     Other clients just go there to talk to her and tell her things to do with their work, and family life. Her work is just to listen, the patron pays and then leaves. The 19 year old adds that others pay for 3 hours just to drink with her without having sex. <br> <br>
     She adds that even when she joins university, she will continue with the work so as to fund her education and upkeep. For now she stays with her parents who know that she has a regular job at a salon in town.
     She easily earns 20,000 shillings a day while the management makes up to 300,000 shillings daily. 

     <br>
     <br>
     Less than two kilometres from this sex den is another discreet sex brothel on Ngong Road. The den has ample parking for eight vehicles reserved for the most loyal and highly valued clients. <br>
     Other clients park their vehicles at a nearby shopping mall and thereafter walk into the sex den. 
     <br>
     The sex den is an old residential house that has been converted into a bar. Here there is no reception and the women aggresively accost the patrons. The services will set you back 6000 shillings.
