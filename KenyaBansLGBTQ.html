            <h1 style="color: white;">Kenya Bans LGBTQ+ Films; Does this Ban really change anything?</h1>

            <p>The Kenya Film Classification Board (KFCB) has announced that all movies containing LGBTQ+ (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer) content will remain outlawed in the country.KFCB Acting CEO Christopher Wambua, said in an interview Friday 23, 2022, that any content promoting  gayism is prohibited by the Kenyan Constitution.  The board will continue to reprimand such material in the media. <br>

                "The country's laws do not allow LGBTQ+ content or even relationships. Even as we rate and classify content, we also consider other applicable laws," Wambua said on Spice FM.
                <br>
                <br>
                
                "If there is any content that normalises or glorifies same-sex relationships, our position in Kenya has always been that kind of content is restricted and should not be broadcasted, exhibited or distributed within the borders of the country."
                <br>
                <br>
                
                Wambua continued by citing examples of movies that were banned from television because of their explicit depictions of homosexuality-related scenes, including <a href="https://www.watchiamsamuel.org/">"I Am Samuel."</a> 
                <br>
                <br>
                
                Wambua mentioned that the government was striving to ensure that preventative steps are implemented to forbid the airing of such content in the nation in response to the increased circulation of same-sex content onlineHe mentioned the Netflix streaming service, stating that negotiations with the American company were in progress to assure that future access to homosexual content would be limited.
                <br>
                <br>
                
                "Most of them are restricting; because of our discussions with Netflix, they are curating their classification system that is very aligned with our laws with the view of ensuring that in future once we sign the agreement, some of this content is not visible at all within the republic," said Wambua.
                
                "Whether you are exhibiting on the theatre or VOD platform, there is no vacuum, the law is very clear."
                <br>
                <br>
                The KFCB CEO also counseled parents to lead the charge in educating their kids through content-filtering to prevent access to inappropriate material. He claimed that doing this would encourage in them appropriate cultural behavior.
                <br>
                <br>
                "Research has shown that film and media content influence the behaviour and the thinking of consumers, especially children who are most impressionable," he said.
                
                "Parents need to set screen times and monitor their child’s internet use because the internet is filled with unfiltered content for kids to be exposed to harmful interactions like bullying and harassment," he said.
                
                "As we try our best to assign the age ratings, it is the responsibility of the parents to educate and sensitize their children that they should not be able to look at it."
                <br>
                
                <h4>My Two Cents</h4>
                <br>
                <br>
               <p> In this era of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancel_culture"> cancel culture </a> one would expect there to be an outrage. In the western world Wambua would probably lose his job. The situation in Kenya is the complete opposite. The majority of the population is against LGBTQ community and it is in the government’s best interest to side with the majority.  
                <br>
                <br>
                I said against, and maybe that is a strong word. You see, we know there have always been gay people. Kenya has <a href="https://nairobinews.nation.africa/kenyan-celebrities-who-are-proudly-gay/"> openly gay celebrities,</a> I bet you know someone who is gay, a relative, a friend, a colleague. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queer">Queer people </a> are among us and have been for the longest time. I do not think Kenyans have a problem with who is sleeping with who, I mean we are busy with our lives.
                <br>
                <br>
                 The problem is the constant bombardment of gayism in the music, the shows, social media. That’s when it gets uncomfortable. I personally do not like it, and would not expose my child to such, at least not in the formative years.
                <br>
                <br>
                If I was a gay activist , I would not lose sleep over such statements by the government. I think the gays won a long time ago. There was a report (I cannot remember where I read it) that mentioned Kenya in a top 10 list of countries that looked up transgender porn. I would argue that  Kenya is probably one of the safest places to be gay in Africa.  All these statements are just hot air and need no reaction from the gays in my view. </p> 
                <br>

                <h2 style="color: white ;">Countries That Have Outlawed Gayism</h2> 
                <br>
                <br>
                
                 <p>  Nearly half of the 69 nations with laws outlawing homosexuality are in the continent of Africa.
                
                However, there have been initiatives to decriminalize same-sex unions in various nations.
                
                President Joao Lourenco of Angola passed a revised penal code into law in February of this year, allowing same-sex couples and outlawing discrimination based on sexual orientation.
                <br>
                <br>
                
                Gabon repealed a rule that made gay intercourse illegal and subject to a six-month prison sentence and a large fine in June of last year.
                
                The High Court of Botswana also decided in 2019 to decriminalize homosexuality. <br>
                
                In recent years, anti-homosexuality laws have also been repealed in Mozambique and the Seychelles.
                 <br>
                 <br>
                 
                
                A court in Trinidad and Tobago declared that laws prohibiting gay sex were unconstitutional in 2018.
                
                However, some nations, like Nigeria and Uganda, have reinforced their existing anti-homosexuality legislation. <br>
                
                And in other places, attempts to have the laws changed have fallen short.
                <br>
                <br>
                
                Early this year, a court in Singapore denied a request to repeal a statute that forbids gay intercourse.
                
                 <br>
                 <br>
                
                The Kenyan high court upheld regulations that make gay activities illegal in May 2019. </p>
<br>                
                <br>

                <h5>Colonial History</h5>
                
          <p>      Numerous laws that forbid homosexual relationships date back to colonial times.
                
                Additionally, breaching these regulations can result in lengthy prison terms in many jurisdictions.
                
                36 of the 53 Commonwealth nations, the majority of which were formerly British colonies, have laws that make homosexuality a crime.
                
                Although the original British laws solely pertained to men, countries that criminalize homosexuality today also have laws that punish women who have sex with other women.
                <br>
                <br>
                 
                
                The development of laws pertaining to homosexuality around the world is tracked by the International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans, and Intersex Association (Ilga).
                
                In Brunei, Iran, Mauritania, Saudi Arabia, Yemen, and the northern states of Nigeria, it is said that the death penalty is the only sanctioned punishment for same-sex sexual acts.
                
                
                The death sentence for consenting to same-sex sexual activity was abolished in Sudan last year.
                Observers have noted that there are specific locations where there is little risk of prosecution.
                
                 <br>
                 <br>
                
                For instance, a 2017 study on Jamaica by the UK Home Office stated that although authorities "do not actively attempt to punish LGBT persons," Jamaica was seen to be a homophobic country.
                
                <br>
                
                Lesbian, homosexual, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) organizations' capacity to engage in advocacy activity, according to activist groups, is being constrained. </p>
                
                 
                
             <h3> Changing trend</h3>  
                 
               <p>
                There is a tendency worldwide to decriminalize same-sex behavior. <br>
                
                According to Ilga, there are currently 28 nations that recognize same-sex marriages, and 34 more that recognize same-sex couples in some capacity.
                
                81 nations had laws prohibiting discrimination in the workplace on the basis of sexual orientation as of December 2020. There were only fifteen twenty years ago. </p>
