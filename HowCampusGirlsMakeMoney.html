            <h1 style="color: white;">How Campus Girls Make Money</h1>

        

        <h3 style="color: orange;">Confessions of Nairobi Call Girls about why the chose this trade </h2>

        <p>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h8xEK4JhlA">The Narams Family</a> is a Youtube Channel that aims to tell the stories of different people from different walks of life. In this particular episode Naram sat down with a Esther (not her real name) who narrated her story of how she became a call girl while at Nairobi university. Get to read their conversation. 
<br>
<br>
 Naram; "Hello guys, we're at the house and I came here with Esther. Of course Esther is not her real name but we'll use it to protect her privacy. Also we've had  her wear a hat, shades and a mask so that we can also protect your dignity unless you feel you're okay to show your face. <br>
 Esther, thank you very much for coming. "
 <br>
 <br>
 Esther: "It's my pleasure."
 <br>
 <br>
 Naram:"So ESther, we have been requesting a lot of call girls to come with us, some accept but most decline our offer. When we tell them to get in out car they refuse. What made you come with us?"
 <br>
 <br>
 Esther: "From the first time, I saw you're just a safe man and I could just drive with you here. And I think meeting you I know after this I'm gonna have some money to spend."
 <br>
 <br>
 Naram: "Some money."
 <br>
 <br>
 Esther: "Yeah."
 <br>
 <br>
 Naram: "So money was a good motivation for you coming here."
 <br>
 <br>
 Esther: "Yeah of course, this is Kenya."
 <br>
 <br>
 Naram: "Of course. We had agreed with Esther that if she gives me just 40 minutes of her life, I would pay you 10,000 shillings. Hapo tumeagree?"
 <br>
 <br>
 Esther: "Hapo tuko sawa sana." 
<br>
<br>
Naram: "The reason why I want 40 minutes of your life is I am thinking, I wanted to show you God and speak to you about Christ. And maybe at the end of this you'll give your life to Christ, that is my prayer. First of all, "Do you know God?" 
<br>
<br>
Esther: "Of course everyone knows God, even Satan himself, anajua Mungu."
<br>
<br>
Naram: "Hata shetani anajua Mungu."
<br>
<br>
Esther: "Yeah."
<br>
<br>
Naram: "Nice. So are you saved, or go to church?"
<br>
<br>
Esther: "Okay, I can't say I'm born again but let's say I know God, I know he exists but I'm not saved. 'Cause, you know, being saved is like being one in Christ, so I'm not saved. But if you insist and give me that... I'm always looking for that man or woman who will make me feel like, okay, this is Christ that I'm serving. But no one has ever come to me and showed me God, blah blah blah, for me to be saved. So I've always been eager, waiting for that man or woman who will show up and tell me I should be born again. "
<br>
<br>
Naram: "And maybe just kwenda nyuma kidogo, do you know the purpose of me giving you the 10,000 shillings before we go on?"
<br>
<br>
Esther: "Okay, the purpose of giving me that 10,000 I guess it's because per day after sleeping with a man, the regular man, I charge 200 shillings."
<br>
<br>
Naram: "200 shillings?"
<br>
<br>
Esther: "Yeah, 200 shillings for sex."
<br>
<br>
Naram: "So in other words, that's 200 shillings for a shot?"
<br>
<br>
Esther: "Yeah, for one shot."
<br>
<br>
Naram: "The reason why I'm giving you the 10,000 is not for you to get saved.  It's just for your time. I think we agree on that. What did you think the 10,000 was for?"
<br>
<br>
Esther: "Of course, ata wewe ungethani ni ya nini sasa?"
<br>
<br>
Naram: "You thought I wanted..."
<br>
<br>
Esther: "Of course, you're cute. I wanted the 10,000, who wouldn't? You're good looking and you look expensive, you know? So I would charge you 10,000, I was sure of that. "
<br>
<br>
Naram: " Wait, you though the 10,000 was for me to sleep with you?"
<br>
<br>
Esther: "Yeah, fucking. And not only fucking but anything else you wanted."
<br>
<br>
Naram: "Well, that's all right. But I want your 40 minutes to talk to you about God, Christ and about heaven. And how you're supposed to live life here on earth. But before we get there, you said you charge 200 shillings a shot?"
<br>
<br>
Esther:  "Yeah"
<br>
<br>
Naram: "So for those who do not understand, what is a shot?"
<br>
<br>
Esther: "One ejaculation, and that's just for the regular man that looks like he's struggling. But the clients who look rich and drive I charge 1500 a shot. But for someone like you who brought me to his house, I was sure that you were going to pay me 10,000 'cause you'd already told me that. But to my surprise... "
<br>
<br>
Naram: "You found I did not want sex."
<br>
<br>
Esther: "I feel like going home."
<br>
<br>
Naram: "If I can ask you, what made you start escorting?"
<br>
<br>
Esther: "Okay, to tell you the truth I was in campus and I joined a group that we used to hangout with. I love partying and we used to go drink and do all sorts of things. But because of my family background we couldn't do all that because my parents never sent me enough money because we would spend up to 20,000 shillings to go partying. My friends would easily afford but I was struggling to keep up. <br>
So I met a man, a sponsor, a mbabaz. He offered to pay for everything to sustain your party life. At first I was hesitant to sleep with an old man but because he offered to pay for my lifestyle I agreed to sleep witth him. After that, for the first time my MPESA read 30,000 shillings and he told me that was just for fare. He said that was nothing for him. He then paid my rent and I was very happy."
<br>
<br>
Naram: "So you met again?"
<br>
<br>
Esther: "No. The last time he just sent me 60,000 shillings and asked me not to contact him again. I used all the money, and as you know, money will never be enough. So that's how it started, it became a habit and then I found myself on the streets wearing short clothes, and here I am."
<br>
<br>
Naram: "So you never met this guy again?"
<br>
<br>
Esther: "I do not even know his name."
<br>
<br>
Naram: "So it was peer pressure that got you into prostitution?"
<br>
<br>
Esther: "Yes."
<br>
<br>
Naram: "What year were you in?"
<br>
<br>
Esther: "I was in first year."

Rose has slept with over 300 men at 16. 
</h3>

<p>
Maina: "Hi."
<br>
<br>
Rose: "Hi."
<br>
<br>
Maina: "Kindly tell the viewers your name"
<br>
<br>
Rose: My name is Roseline Chepngetich Cheluget. 


<br>
<br>
Maina: "From which county?" 
<br>
<br>
Rose: "Nakuru, Njoro."
<br>
<br>
Maina: "How old are you right now?"
<br>
<br>
Rose: "24."
<br>
<br>
Maina: "So maybe you can tell us your story. What work do you do now?"
<br>
<br>
Rose: "Okay, I'm a call girl. I sell myself."
<br>
<br>
Maina: "Did you go to school/complete your studies?"
<br>
<br>
Rose: "No I didn't finish school. I had to stop my studies when I was in Form two because my parents could not afford to keep me in school."
<br>
<br>
Maina: "Are they still alive?"
<br>
<br>
Rose: "Yes, they are alive. They are farmers."
<br>
<br>
Maina: "Do they know what you do?"
<br>
<br>
Rose: "No, they don't." 
<br>
<br>
Maina: "What if they watch this? Are you okay with that?"
<br>
<br>
Rose: "This is my life."
<br>
<br>
Maina: "When you left school you came to Nairobi for work. What work did you come to do?"
<br>
<br>
Rose: "When I came to Nairobi, my cousin had told me there was work available at a local restaurant. She did not specify what type of work it was, she just told me I would be working at a hotel. "
<br>
<br>
Maina: So when you came did you get to work at the hotel?
<br>
<br>
Rose: "No. I found out that they were selling their bodies." 
<br>
<br>
Maina: "Which year was this?"
<br>
<br>
Rose: "It was in 2013."
<br>
<br>
Maina: "SO you agreed to join them?"
<br>
<br>
Rose: "I was hesitant at first. The house my cousin had rented housed many girls, like four or five of them. Each day they contributed money they'd earned to buy food and pay the rent. Since I was not working I was not able to contribute. No one would share their food with me, they also hid house supplies from me. For me to live well I needed the money so I decided to join them. My parents also expected me to send money to them since they knew I had gotten work in Nairobi. "
<br>
<br>
Maina: So it's your cousin who introduced you? 
<br>
<br>
Rose: "Yes."
<br>
<br>
Maina: "Tell me about your first job."
<br>
<br>
Rose: "I was assigned to a man. He had already booked a room. The man took me out to eat and also introduced me to alcohol. "
<br>
<br>
Maina: "How old were you at that time?"
<br>
<br>
Rose: "I was 16/17 years."
<br>
<br>
Maina: "So how was it? How much did he pay you?"
<br>
<br>
Rose: " He paid me 400 shillings. He was supposed to pay me 1000 but my cousin took the bigger share. I don't know why she took it and I never asked why."
<br>
<br>
Maina: "After the first encounter did you think that maybe this is not for you."
<br>
<br>
Rose: "I was disgusted sleeping with that man. I never thought I would ever do such a thing. I never thought I would sell my body for sex. I had to continue because the challenges kept piling up. I soon discovered I was pregnant with my boyfriend's baby. I had to work while pregnant to prepare for the baby's birth."
<br>
<br>
Maina: "Did you ever think to look for other work?"
<br>
<br>
Rose: "No, this was fast money."
<br>
<br>
Maina: "What's the most you've been paid by a client?"
<br>
<br>
Rose: "2000 shillings"
<br>
<br>
Maina: "Minimum?"
<br>
<br>
Rose: "400 shillings."
<br>
<br>
Maina: "You've worked a sex worker for nine years so far, do you regret it?"
<br>
<br>
Rose: "I do, because no parent feels good to know her child is a prostitute. I regret a lot."
<br>
<br>
Maina: "How many men do you sleep with in a night?"
<br>
<br>
Rose: "Four or five men."
<br>
<br>
Maina: "Do you use protection?"
<br>
<br>
Rose: "Not all the time. If someone offers to pay me 2500 I do have raw sex. I use PREP. I take a pill a day to prevent HIV, and go the VCT every three months."
<br>
<br>

Call girls on Telegram
</h3>

<p>
    Here's how to get working as a kenyan call girl on Telegram. This is the story of a succesful call girl who was introduced to being an escort for extra income. <br> <br>

    Keziah (not her real name) lives and works from Ngong Road. She is a single mother of two children, one is in high school and the other is in primary school. She started escorting back in 2020 when she lost her job to COVID-19. The money she had saved up to help open a business was used to cater for her household expenses.  When her money ran out she had nowhere to turn to and no one to help her out financialy. 
    <br> <br>
    As she was job searching on her phone she came accross advertisments on Telegram to see what it is they do exactly. The advert read that they needed a kenyan call girl for massage and sexual services. I called and asked for the job. I have been working on the website for two years now , paying my rent, food and school fees for my children. <br> <br>

    The clients simply go to her house after they get her number from this escorting page. It is a very easy way to make a living as she applies for a formal job. She only needs to pay a small fee every month for her contacts to be uploaded to the site.
