    Types of Girls You Will FInd at Clubs In Meru. 
</h2>

<p> The club is a natural habitat for young, sherehe-loving Kneyans. Go to any of the clubs in Meru anytime of the week and it will be full of people partying. Meru night life is rich and varied but in every club you visit you are likely to encounter one of these ladies. </p>

<h4>
    The hot chic
</h4>
     <p>
        She comes dressed to kill. She will be clad with in the shortest handkerchief she could find with an 'over the shoulder boulder holder' barely hanging on. She is hot and she knows it. She will be the one sitted nonchalantly just waiting for a thirsty guy to make his move. If she's alone then you're sure she's baiting someone. Be sure to carry some cash and some senses with you if you chose to make your move. <br> 
     </p>

     <h4>
        Birthday Girl 
     </h4>

     <p>
        You will always find a birthday girl at a Meru club. She will be surrounded by a gaggle of noisy friends and a table groaning under the weight of bottles. They are determined to have a good time. Bottles may start breaking and some fights may ensue as the night carries on. It's always a great sote to see, the transition from sober to drunken chaos. 
     </p>

     <h4>Couple goals</h4>

     <p>
        This lady made the ill-advised decision to go out with her boyfriend. It was supposed to be a fun-filled night to celebrate their love. Instead, they are filled with insecurity as the man can't keep his eyes off the ladies and she can't keep the men away. They most certainly end up quarelling on their way back home.  
     </p>

     <h4>
        I have a boyfriend
     </h4>

     <p>
        She is most identifiable from the DO NOT APPROACH stamp on her forehead. It's not entirely by choice; she is an attractive woman. Even though hoping for a nice alone, she has to constantly deflect an endless barrage of propositions from men all night. Her only defence is 'I have boyfriend'. Not that it works, it infacts encourages Kenyan men. Kenyans have a weird fetish of destroying relationships. 
     </p>

     <h4>
        The veteran
     </h4>

     <p>
        She understands the nuances of drinking alcohol and partying. She makes for great company in the bar as she can handle her alcohol.  
     </p>

     <h4>
        Mumama
     </h4>

     <p>
        She sits alone at the bar quietly sipping her beer as she preys for some young stallions. She rarely involves herself in the melee, preffering to sway lightly in her chair if the music hits the spot, or stand up and gyrate slowly on the spot.  
     </p>

     <h4>
        Wingwoman
     </h4>

     <p> AKA the cockblocker. She is the one who should have staid at her home; out here ruining the fun for everyone. Wingwomen are no fun. 
        
    </p>

    <h4>
        The chimney
    </h4>

    <p>
        She went for the liqour but stayed for the shisha. She is in a corner for most of the night, buried behind a cloud of smoke so thick it would need fog lights to penetrate. She smells like strawberry vanilla lung cancer. She has dark lips and lazy eyes. She can hold five litres of flavored smoke in her mouth, and release it in trickles over the next hours. 
    </p>

    <h4>
        The lightweight
    </h4>

    <p>
        The poor girl went out with merciless people. They shoved shot glasses into her hands even before she sat down. And they kept them coming. One cocktail later, the girl is teetering on her chair, giggling sheepishly and dishing out hugs to passersby, If you see someone zooming around the club acting crazy, that's her. 
    </p>

    <h4>
        Newly-Single
    </h4>
    <p>
        She is at the club to blow off some steam, some illict smoke, and hopefully forget about Kevo. She will be the one pouring spirits straight down her throat as she rants, Or she will be the one aggressively trying to mount the bartender because she knows the best way to get over someone. But she will indulge for sure.
